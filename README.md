## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 16)
- NPM
- MongoDB (or adjust if using a different database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hackernews-search-app.git
cd hackernews-search-app

    Install dependencies:

cd server
npm install

cd ../client
npm install

Running the Project

Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.
Option 1: Start Both Servers Separately

# In one terminal
cd server
npm start

# In another terminal
cd client
npm start

Option 2: Start Both Servers with One Command

Install concurrently if needed:

npm install --save concurrently

Add this to your root package.json:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
  "server": "cd server && npm start",
  "client": "cd client && npm start"
}

Then run:

npm run dev

Option 3: Windows Batch File

Create a start_project.bat file:

@echo off
cd /d "%~dp0"

start cmd /k "cd server && npm start"
start cmd /k "cd client && npm start"

Double-click to start both parts of the app.
    Authentication

    Users can register and log in.

    Authenticated users receive a JWT token stored in memory (via React Context).

    Token is used to authorize rating and commenting actions.
